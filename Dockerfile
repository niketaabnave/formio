# Use Node image, maintained by Docker:
# hub.docker.com/r/_/node/
FROM node:lts-alpine3.19
WORKDIR /app

# "bcrypt" requires python/make/g++, all must be installed in alpine
# (note: using pinned versions to ensure immutable build environment)
RUN apk update && \
    apk upgrade && \
    apk add make && \
    apk add g++

# At least one buried package dependency is using a `git` path.
# Hence we need to haul in git.
RUN apk --update add git
# Use https to avoid requiring ssh keys for public repos.
RUN git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "ssh://git@github.com/"

# Use "Continuous Integration" to install as-is from package-lock.json
RUN npm ci

RUN apk del git

# Set this to inspect more from the application. Examples:
#   DEBUG=formio:db (see index.js for more)
#   DEBUG=formio:*
ENV DEBUG=""

# This will initialize the application based on
# some questions to the user (login email, password, etc.)
